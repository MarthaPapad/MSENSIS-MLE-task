# MSENSIS-MLE task
This repository is dedicated to a mSensis MLE task on image classification. It covers the full workflow including data preprocessing, model training and evaluation using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

All comments, observations, and results are included within the notebook.

The notebook uses a dataset of images and a CSV file with labels. Due to the size of the dataset, the images are not included in this repository. The dataset used here is similar to publicly available cat vs dog image datasets on Kaggle.
